# 🔧 Flutter Auth Email Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your **admin shop approval emails work** because they use nodemailer directly with Gmail. 
Your **Flutter app auth emails don't work** because the emailService was using different configuration.

## 🚀 Fix Applied

I've updated the `emailService.js` to use the **exact same Gmail configuration** as your working admin emails:

```javascript
// Now using the same configuration that works for admin emails
this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD
  }
});
```

## 📧 Environment Variables Needed

Set these in your **Render Environment** tab:

```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

## 🧪 What You'll See After Deploy

**Success logs:**
```
✅ Email service configured with Gmail
✅ Email service ready to send emails
Sending OTP email to: user@example.com
✅ OTP sent successfully to user@example.com
```

**If email credentials are missing:**
```
❌ Email credentials not found. Email functionality disabled.
📧 Mock OTP sent to user@example.com (email not configured)
[DEV ONLY] Email content: ShopRadar - Your Verification Code
```

## 🔄 Code Changes Made

1. **Simplified Gmail configuration** - using exact same config as working admin emails
2. **Removed complex timeout settings** - kept it simple like admin emails
3. **Better error handling** - shows mock emails when not configured
4. **Cleaner logging** - easier to debug

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set Gmail credentials** in Render environment variables
2. **Deploy** the updated code
3. **Test** Flutter app registration
4. **Check logs** for success messages

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Render logs** for the exact error message
2. **Verify Gmail app password** is 16 characters without spaces
3. **Ensure EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD** are set correctly
4. **Test with a fresh Gmail account** if needed

Your Flutter app authentication emails should now work exactly like the admin emails! 🎉
